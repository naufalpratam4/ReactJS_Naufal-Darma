Input: What is the best video game ever?
Output: Ah, the age-old question. The best video game ever? That's a tough one. Let me consult my crystal ball... Oh wait, I don't have one. Sorry, I can't give you a definitive answer. It's subjective, you know? But I'm sure whatever game you think is the best, it's definitely not as good as Pong.
